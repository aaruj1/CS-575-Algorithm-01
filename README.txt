This code checks if there are any element which is the difference between the other two elements in the array. It takes two command-line arguments: one is an input filename which will have the set of numbers and other is an output file name where it will write the sets of elements which are the difference of the elements present in the input file.


Below are the steps to run the submission.cpp :

Step 1: Use the makefile to compile the code        $make all
Step 2: Run the code with 2 command line-argument input file and output file name 	$./submission input.txt output.txt
